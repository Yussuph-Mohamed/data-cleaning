# Titanic dataset: data cleaning and validation
### Author: Jesús Ros Solé

## Objective

The objective of this project is to understand the factors that contribute to the survival of the Titatic accident and to build a model to estimate the survival 
probability of passengers. In more detail we will:

- Perform data cleaning and validation techniques to prepare data for analysis.
- Analise resulting dataset to discover correlations between features and compare different passenger groups.
- Build a model to estimate survival probability of Titanic passengers.
